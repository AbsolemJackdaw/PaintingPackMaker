            Changes
            - Add progress bar when loading images
            - Add auto-detector for painting sizes. (it uses the image size to autofill the size fields)
            - Base window is now 960 pixels wide instead of 720 to better fit the changes in the UI
            Fixes
            - Fix error cards being out of whack
            - Image loading improvement : threads are now used and greatly improve loading times
