### Requirements

- Java 17 (might require you to install the jdk instead of the jre)
- Minecraft 1.17 and up
- (optional) A png image optimizer like [Pinga](https://css-ig.net/pinga)

### Installing  Usage

Download the above .jar file.  
Run the .jar with Java.  
Alternatively, right click the .jar file and select 'open with'> 'Java(TM) Platform'

### Making a pack

#### Step 1

Click 'Select Images'.  
Select the images you want to make paintings from.   
Ideally, you will have optimized the images beforehand with an image optimizer like [Pinga](https://css-ig.net/pinga)  
If the images are not valid, PPM will tell you.

Valid images are

- .png files
- file name only contains following characters : a-z 0-9 . / _ -

#### Step 2

Define the size of your image buy picking one of the radio buttons,  
or defining a custom size in the given numerical text fields.

#### Step 3 (optional)

Define a unique custom id to your pack in the 'Unique Id' text field.  
This is optional, but highly recommended.  
Taking this step will prevent any possible duplicate errors from other packs.

#### Step 4

Click 'Finalize Pack'.    
Pick a place to export your painting pack to.  
Name your file and select 'Ok'

#### Step 5

Make sure you have Paintings++ installed.

Drop your generated resourcepack in the resourcepack folder of your minecraft game.

Enjoy the painting pack !!
